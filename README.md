### Hi, I'm Samantha! 👋🏾


I am a software developer and recent graduate of Flatiron's Software Engineering bootcamp. I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks, and so far I have worked with JavaScript, React, Vue, Node, and Ruby on Rails. My current favorite styling framework is Tailwind CSS. In 2022, I would love to explore Python, Django, and  TypeScript!
